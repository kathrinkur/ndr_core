            This repository is an outcome of the Europa Institute Basel research program of the same
            name, funded by Swiss National Science Foundation under grant 100011_184860/1. It provides
            unrestricted access to sub-collections from multiple archival sources, representing persons
            documented by authorities in South East Asian countries between 1920 and 1945, including
            electoral and internment records. Although these datasets contain 'instances' of
            persons—often without accompanying information complete enough to identify individuals
            unequivocally—they are nevertheless official records providing precise data, and they have
            been designed to support automated discovery across multiple instances to build candidate
            individual person entities.

                            recently released by the French Government, and analyzed them using

f52bf-dy392,Les ressortissants américains confinés à Mytho,"October 4, 1943",internment_lists,10,"The attached datasets contain the names of 32 American citizens interned in the Civilian Internment Camp in Mytho, some 70 kilometres outside of Saigon. After the attack on Pearl Harbour, the Japanese Military pressured the French Administration in Indochina to intern the allied civilians in the colony. The list was compiled by the Swiss Consul in Saigon, Hans Hirsbrunner and was sent to the American delegation in early October 1943. It contains additional information about persons wishing to be repatriated to the United States on board the SS Teia Maru, which sailed from Saigon on 30th September 1943. The original documents are now held at the Swiss Federal Archives in Bern. This sub-collection has provided the Divisive Power of Citizenship and Loyalty (DPCL) project with one of its most valuable datasets to date—supporting investigation of French citizens in French Indochina during World War II.

Multiple datasets generated from the source material, including transcriptions of person entries (names, dates of birth and death where available, profession and often location, remarks and operating unit) and structured person instance data derived from them are provided. Key historic person instance information (appearances in documents), serialized as JSON according to a formal schema is available, together with the JSON Schema itself. This is intended for use by external applications, and can also be searched interactively using a DPCL presentation website (see below) which explains the datasets further. In contrast to transcription data, which represents the printed and hand-written source material, and is often organized inconsistently, the historic person instance data provided here enables reliable searching across multiple archival sources. The historic person instance JSON is lightweight to enable scalability across large numbers of sub-collections/archives: it does not contain all of the information sometimes transcribed, such as remarks and military operating unit. However it does provide IIIF canvas IDs, connecting the person instance to the page in the source document where it originally occurred.

Where annotations can be generated from transcriptions they are provided as Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) annotation collections serialized as JSON, which are linked to source documents via PIDs. The annotation data can be used independently with the IIIF service provided here, to connect person instances interactively to their occurrence in the source documents. Provided principally for analysis preservation and verification purposes, the transcription data is less suitable for automated searching than the historic person instance JSON (above).

These datasets are also deposited in the Zenodo global catch-all repository as record DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6813785.

However, after the Japanese Coup d'État of 9 March 1945, nearly all French citizens experienced internment or house arrest, often only for a few days.

Multiple datasets generated from the source material, including transcriptions of person entries (names, dates of birth and death where available, profession and often location, remarks and operating unit) and structured person instance data derived from them are provided. Key historic person instance information (appearances in documents), serialized as JSON according to a formal schema is available, together with the JSON Schema itself. This is intended for use by external applications, and can also be searched interactively using a DPCL presentation website (see below) which explains the datasets further. In contrast to transcription data, which represents the printed and hand-written source material, and is often organized inconsistently, the historic person instance data provided here enables reliable searching across multiple archival sources. The historic person instance JSON is lightweight to enable scalability across large numbers of sub-collections/archives: it does not contain all of the information sometimes transcribed, such as remarks and military operating unit. However it does provide IIIF canvas IDs, connecting the person instance to the page in the source document where it originally occurred.

Where annotations can be generated from transcriptions they are provided as Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) annotation collections serialized as JSON, which are linked to source documents via PIDs. The annotation data can be used independently with the IIIF service provided here, to connect person instances interactively to their occurrence in the source documents. Provided principally for analysis preservation and verification purposes, the transcription data is less suitable for automated searching than the historic person instance JSON (above).

g7p27-1ge25,Légion française des combattants et des volontaires de la Révolution nationale Annam,1941/1944,LFCVRN,1,"This record relates to approximately 347 members of the Union of the so-called ""Légion française des combattants et des volontaires de la Révolution nationale"" in Annam. This list is not a complete register of the members of the organization. Information was gathered from the magazine ""Le Légionnaire du Tonkin"". The Tonkin magazine also includes information regarding the chapter in Laos. Original documents are now held at the Archives nationales Pierrefitte-sur-Seine and were compiled during the War. The Légion, which was established by Philippe Pétain in August 1940, combined the existing Veteran's organization. By November 1941, admission to the Légion was opened for non-combatants as well. It served as a means to propagate Vichy Ideologies throughout the empire.

Multiple datasets generated from the source material, including transcriptions of person entries (names, dates of birth and death where available, profession and often location, remarks and operating unit) and structured person instance data derived from them are provided. Key historic person instance information (appearances in documents), serialized as JSON according to a formal schema is available, together with the JSON Schema itself. This is intended for use by external applications, and can also be searched interactively using a DPCL presentation website (see below) which explains the datasets further. In contrast to transcription data, which represents the printed and hand-written source material, and is often organized inconsistently, the historic person instance data provided here enables reliable searching across multiple archival sources. The historic person instance JSON is lightweight to enable scalability across large numbers of sub-collections/archives: it does not contain all of the information sometimes transcribed, such as remarks and military operating unit. However it does provide IIIF canvas IDs, connecting the person instance to the page in the source document where it originally occurred.

Where annotations can be generated from transcriptions they are provided as Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) annotation collections serialized as JSON, which are linked to source documents via PIDs. The annotation data can be used independently with the IIIF service provided here, to connect person instances interactively to their occurrence in the source documents. Provided principally for analysis preservation and verification purposes, the transcription data is less suitable for automated searching than the historic person instance JSON (above).

These datasets are also deposited in the Zenodo global catch-all repository as record DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.7065161.
